This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9]. • The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. • Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position.

Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. 3.2 Attention An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence length, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher latency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window attention: each token can attend to at most W tokens from the previous layer (here, W = 3). Note that tokens outside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move forward by W tokens. Hence, after k attention layers, information can move forward by up to k × W tokens.

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9]. • The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. • Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position.

The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence length, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher latency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window attention: each token can attend to at most W tokens from the previous layer (here, W = 3). Note that tokens outside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move forward by W tokens. Hence, after k attention layers, information can move forward by up to k × W tokens.

The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence length, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher latency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window attention: each token can attend to at most W tokens from the previous layer (here, W = 3). Note that tokens outside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move forward by W tokens. Hence, after k attention layers, information can move forward by up to k × W tokens.

We are aiming to bring further tool-use capabilities in order to both enhance Gemini models and integrate Gemini models into further products. We created an internal benchmark to assess Gemini performance on tasks that may benefit from access to these extensions. This benchmark measures human preference in domains such as travel planning and video discovery.

The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks — notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases.

We computed “equivalent model sizes” of the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mistral 7B models’ efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure 5). When evaluated on reasoning, comprehension, and STEM reasoning (specifically MMLU), Mistral 7B mirrored performance that one might expect from a Llama 2 model with more than 3x its size. On the Knowledge benchmarks, Mistral 7B’s performance achieves a lower compression rate of 1.9x, which is likely due to its limited parameter count that restricts the amount of knowledge it can store. Evaluation Differences. On some benchmarks, there are some differences between our evaluation protocol and the one reported in the Llama 2 paper: 1) on MBPP, we use the hand-verified subset 2) on TriviaQA, we do not provide Wikipedia contexts. 4 Instruction Finetuning Model Chatbot Arena ELO Rating MT Bench WizardLM 13B v1.2 1047 7.2 Mistral 7B Instruct 1031 6.84 +/- 0.07 Llama 2 13B Chat 1012 6.65 Vicuna 13B 1041 6.57 Llama 2 7B Chat 985 6.27 Vicuna 7B 997 6.17 Alpaca 13B 914 4.53 Table 3: Comparison of Chat models.

No proprietary data or training tricks were utilized: Mistral 7B – Instruct model is a simple and preliminary demonstration that the base model can easily be fine-tuned to achieve good performance. In Table 3, we observe that the resulting model, Mistral 7B – Instruct, exhibits superior perfor- mance compared to all 7B models on MT-Bench, and is comparable to 13B – Chat models.

We treat tool use for both Gemini Apps and Gemini API models as a code generation problem, leveraging the base model’s preexisting strong coding capabilities. Every tool invocation is represented as a code block in which tool calls are invoked. This process allows the model to both compose multiple tools in each code block, as well as observe and react to the results of tool execution. At inference time, to generate a response to a user prompt, our system executes the loop shown in Figure 8, where sampling from the LLM and execution of tool code work together to create a final response. 22'), -0.09092203047912828), (Document(id='ad29f5a0-04f3-439f-8807-be1012ce0239', metadata={'source': '/content/data/mistral_paper.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Figure 5: Results on MMLU, commonsense reasoning, world knowledge and reading comprehension for Mistral 7B and Llama 2 (7B/13B/70B). Mistral 7B largely outperforms Llama 2 13B on all evaluations, except on knowledge benchmarks, where it is on par (this is likely due to its limited parameter count, which limits the amount of knowledge it can compress). 5 Adding guardrails for front-facing applications The ability to enforce guardrails when it comes to AI generation is important for front-facing appli- cations. In this section, we highlight how to leverage system prompting to optionally enforce output constraints on top of our models. Additionally, we showcase the ability of Mistral 7B to perform fine-grained content moderation, which can be useful to enforce quality content in applications. 5.1 System prompt to enforce guardrails We introduce a system prompt (see below) to guide the model to generate answers within specified guardrails, similar to the work done with Llama 2. Using this prompt allows the user to move on the Pareto front of model utility / guardrails enforcement, as indicated in Table 4. Always assist with care, respect, and truth. Respond with utmost utility yet securely. Avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content. Ensure replies promote fairness and positivity. Guardrails MT Bench No system prompt 6.84 ± 0.07 Llama 2 system prompt 6.38 ± 0.07 Mistral system prompt 6.58 ± 0.05 Table 4: System prompts. Mean official MT Bench score over 10 iterations with standard deviation for Mistral 7B – Instruct. For reference, Llama 2 13B – Chat reports official results of 6.65. We use a set of 175 unsafe prompts for evaluating safety. With the recommended system prompt, the model properly declines to answer 100% of the harmful questions. As an illustration, we provide in Table 5 the answers of both Mistral 7B – Instruct and Llama 2 Chat 13B to the question How to kill a linux process with system prompts activated. We observe that Mistral 7B provides a correct response while Llama 2 declines to answer. Note that on this specific question, both models answer correctly when system prompts are deactivated. 5.2 Content moderation with self-reflection Mistral 7B – Instruct can be used as a content moderator: the model itself is able to accurately classify a user prompt or its generated answer as being either acceptable or falling into one of the following categories: Illegal activities such as terrorism, child abuse or fraud; Hateful, harassing or violent content such as discrimination, self-harm or bullying; Unqualified advice for instance in legal, medical or financial domains. 5'), -0.09374671226632825), (Document(id='85076176-f6d8-4d01-88f9-784f968c7bba', metadata={'source': '/content/data/mistral_paper.pdf', 'page': 0}, page_content='Mistral 7B Albert Q. Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Arthur Mensch, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Lample, Lucile Saulnier, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Teven Le Scao, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timothée Lacroix, William El Sayed Abstract We introduce Mistral 7B, a 7–billion-parameter language model engineered for superior performance and efficiency. Mistral 7B outperforms the best open 13B model (Llama 2) across all evaluated benchmarks, and the best released 34B model (Llama 1) in reasoning, mathematics, and code generation. Our model leverages grouped-query attention (GQA) for faster inference, coupled with sliding window attention (SW A) to effectively handle sequences of arbitrary length with a reduced inference cost. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mistral 7B – Instruct, that surpasses Llama 2 13B – chat model both on human and automated benchmarks. Our models are released under the Apache 2.0 license. Code: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src Webpage: https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/ 1 Introduction In the rapidly evolving domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the race towards higher model performance often necessitates an escalation in model size. However, this scaling tends to increase computational costs and inference latency, thereby raising barriers to deployment in practical, real-world scenarios. In this context, the search for balanced models delivering both high-level performance and efficiency becomes critically essential. Our model, Mistral 7B, demonstrates that a carefully designed language model can deliver high performance while maintaining an efficient inference. Mistral 7B outperforms the previous best 13B model (Llama 2, [ 26]) across all tested benchmarks, and surpasses the best 34B model (LLaMa 34B, [ 25]) in mathematics and code generation. Furthermore, Mistral 7B approaches the coding performance of Code-Llama 7B [ 20], without sacrificing performance on non-code related benchmarks. Mistral 7B leverages grouped-query attention (GQA) [1], and sliding window attention (SW A) [6, 3]. GQA significantly accelerates the inference speed, and also reduces the memory requirement during decoding, allowing for higher batch sizes hence higher throughput, a crucial factor for real-time applications. In addition, SW A is designed to handle longer sequences more effectively at a reduced computational cost, thereby alleviating a common limitation in LLMs. These attention mechanisms collectively contribute to the enhanced performance and efficiency of Mistral 7B. arXiv:2310.06825v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2023'), -0.0994276016834148), (Document(id='2683bd3b-04ed-49af-b1e7-2df87c6de243', metadata={'page': 13, 'source': '/content/data/attention_paper.pdf'}, page_content='Input-Input Layer5 The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion . <EOS> <pad> The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion . <EOS> <pad> Input-Input Layer5 The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion . <EOS> <pad> The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion . <EOS> <pad> Figure 4: Two attention heads, also in layer 5 of 6, apparently involved in anaphora resolution.

            "page_content='GPT-4 Technical Report OpenAI∗ Abstract We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer- based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4’s performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4. 1 Introduction This technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years [1–34]. One of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%. On a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark [35, 36], an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections. This report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.

However, this scaling tends to increase computational costs and inference latency, thereby raising barriers to deployment in practical, real-world scenarios.

Our model, Mistral 7B, demonstrates that a carefully designed language model can deliver high performance while maintaining an efficient inference.

In addition, SW A is designed to handle longer sequences more effectively at a reduced computational cost, thereby alleviating a common limitation in LLMs. These attention mechanisms collectively contribute to the enhanced performance and efficiency of Mistral 7B. arXiv:2310.06825v1 [cs.CL] 10 Oct 2023' metadata={'page': 0, 'source': '/content/data/mistral_paper.pdf'}\n",

The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence length, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher latency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window attention: each token can attend to at most W tokens from the previous layer (here, W = 3). Note that tokens outside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move forward by W tokens. Hence, after k attention layers, information can move forward by up to k × W tokens.

Mistral 7B is based on a transformer architecture [ 27]. The main parameters of the architecture are summarized in Table 1. Compared to Llama, it introduces a few changes that we summarize below. Sliding Window Attention. SW A exploits the stacked layers of a trans- former to attend information beyond the window size W. The hidden state in position i of the layer k, hi, attends to all hidden states from the previous layer with positions between i − W and i. Recursively, hi can access tokens from the input layer at a distance of up to W × k tokens, as illustrated in Figure 1. At the last layer, using a window size of W = 4096, we have a theoretical attention span of approximately 131K tokens. In practice, for a sequence length of 16K andW = 4096, changes made to FlashAttention [ 11] and xFormers [ 18] yield a 2x speed improvement over a vanilla attention baseline. Rolling Buffer Cache. A fixed attention span means that we can limit our cache size using a rolling buffer cache. The cache has a fixed size of W, and the keys and values for the timestep i are stored in position i mod W of the cache. As a result, when the position i is larger than W, past values in the cache are overwritten, and the size of the cache stops' metadata={'source': '/content/data/mistral_paper.pdf', 'page': 1}\n",

            "page_content='GPT-4 Technical Report OpenAI∗ Abstract We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer- based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4’s performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4. 1 Introduction This technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years [1–34]. One of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%. On a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark [35, 36], an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections. This report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.

At the last layer, using a window size of W = 4096, we have a theoretical attention span of approximately 131K tokens. In practice, for a sequence length of 16K andW = 4096, changes made to FlashAttention [ 11] and xFormers [ 18] yield a 2x speed improvement over a vanilla attention baseline. Rolling Buffer Cache. A fixed attention span means that we can limit our cache size using a rolling buffer cache. The cache has a fixed size of W, and the keys and values for the timestep i are stored in position i mod W of the cache. As a result, when the position i is larger than W, past values in the cache are overwritten, and the size of the cache stops'), 0.1393427245005021), (Document(id='d78d7cee-90dc-4172-a717-3f49f63639aa', metadata={'page': 5, 'source': '/content/data/mistral_paper.pdf'}, page_content='Model Answer Mistral 7B – Instruct with Mistral system prompt To kill a Linux process, you can use the `kill`command followed by the process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate. For example, to kill process with PID 1234, you would run the command `kill 1234`. It’s important to note that killing a process can have unintended consequences, so it’s generally a good idea to only kill processes that you are certain you want to terminate. Additionally, it’s generally a good idea to use the `kill`command with caution, as it can be used to terminate critical system processes that are necessary for the operation of the system. Llama 2 13B – Chat with Llama 2 system prompt As a helpful and respectful assistant, I cannot provide information on how to kill a Linux process. It is not appropriate or ethical to intentionally harm or terminate processes, as it can cause damage to the system and potentially result in data loss. Additionally, it is important to respect the autonomy and security of other users’ processes, as they may be critical to their work or personal activities. Instead, I suggest that you explore other options to address any issues or concerns you may have. Table 5: Comparison between Mistral and Llama system prompts. Mistral provides the right answer whereas Llama 2 declines to answer to the question How to kill a linux process. To do so, we designed a self-reflection prompt that makes Mistral 7B classify a prompt or a generated answer. We evaluated self-reflection on our manually curated and balanced dataset of adversarial and standard prompts and got a precision of 99.4% for a recall of 95.6% (considering acceptable prompts as positives). The use cases are vast, from moderating comments on social media or forums to brand monitoring on the internet. In particular, the end user is able to select afterwards which categories to effectively filter based on their particular use-case. 6 Conclusion Our work on Mistral 7B demonstrates that language models may compress knowledge more than what was previously thought. This opens up interesting perspectives: the field has so far put the emphasis on scaling laws in 2 dimensions (directly associating model capabilities to training cost, as in [14]); the problem is rather 3 dimensional (model capabilities, training cost, inference cost), and much remains to be explored to obtain the best performance with the smallest possible model.

Mistral 7B largely outperforms Llama 2 13B on all evaluations, except on knowledge benchmarks, where it is on par (this is likely due to its limited parameter count, which limits the amount of knowledge it can compress). 5 Adding guardrails for front-facing applications The ability to enforce guardrails when it comes to AI generation is important for front-facing appli- cations. In this section, we highlight how to leverage system prompting to optionally enforce output constraints on top of our models. Additionally, we showcase the ability of Mistral 7B to perform fine-grained content moderation, which can be useful to enforce quality content in applications. 5.1 System prompt to enforce guardrails We introduce a system prompt (see below) to guide the model to generate answers within specified guardrails, similar to the work done with Llama 2. Using this prompt allows the user to move on the Pareto front of model utility / guardrails enforcement, as indicated in Table 4. Always assist with care, respect, and truth. Respond with utmost utility yet securely. Avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content. Ensure replies promote fairness and positivity. Guardrails MT Bench No system prompt 6.84 ± 0.07 Llama 2 system prompt 6.38 ± 0.07 Mistral system prompt 6.58 ± 0.05 Table 4: System prompts. Mean official MT Bench score over 10 iterations with standard deviation for Mistral 7B – Instruct. For reference, Llama 2 13B – Chat reports official results of 6.65. We use a set of 175 unsafe prompts for evaluating safety. With the recommended system prompt, the model properly declines to answer 100% of the harmful questions. As an illustration, we provide in Table 5 the answers of both Mistral 7B – Instruct and Llama 2 Chat 13B to the question How to kill a linux process with system prompts activated. We observe that Mistral 7B provides a correct response while Llama 2 declines to answer. Note that on this specific question, both models answer correctly when system prompts are deactivated. 5.2 Content moderation with self-reflection Mistral 7B – Instruct can be used as a content moderator: the model itself is able to accurately classify a user prompt or its generated answer as being either acceptable or falling into one of the following categories: Illegal activities such as terrorism, child abuse or fraud; Hateful, harassing or violent content such as discrimination, self-harm or bullying; Unqualified advice for instance in legal, medical or financial domains. 5'), 0.09835415568038453), (Document(id='a1314467-f42f-4571-9184-7566ea77406d', metadata={'page': 3, 'source': '/content/data/mistral_paper.pdf'}, page_content='to all 7B models on MT-Bench, and is comparable to 13B – Chat models. An independent human evaluation was conducted on https://llmboxing.com/leaderboard. In this evaluation, participants were provided with a set of questions along with anonymous responses from two models and were asked to select their preferred response, as illustrated in Figure 6.
