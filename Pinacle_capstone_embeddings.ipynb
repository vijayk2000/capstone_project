Our InstructGPT models (PPO-ptx) as well as its variant trained without pretraining mix (PPO) signiﬁcantly outperform the GPT-3 baselines (GPT, GPT prompted); outputs from our 1.3B PPO-ptx model are preferred to those from the 175B GPT-3. Error bars throughout the paper are 95% conﬁdence intervals. used for many recent large LMs—predicting the next token on a webpage from the internet—is different from the objective “follow the user’s instructions helpfully and safely” (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022). Thus, we say that the language modeling objective is misaligned. Averting these unintended behaviors is especially important for language models that are deployed and used in hundreds of applications. We make progress on aligning language models by training them to act in accordance with the user’s intention (Leike et al., 2018). This encompasses both explicit intentions such as following instructions and implicit intentions such as staying truthful, and not being biased, toxic, or otherwise harmful. Using the language of Askell et al. (2021), we want language models to be helpful (they should help the user solve their task), honest (they shouldn’t fabricate information or mislead the user), and harmless (they should not cause physical, psychological, or social harm to people or the environment). We elaborate on the evaluation of these criteria in Section 3.6. We focus on ﬁne-tuning approaches to aligning language models. Speciﬁcally, we use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF; Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020) to ﬁne-tune GPT-3 to follow a broad class of written instructions (see Figure 2). This technique uses human preferences as a reward signal to ﬁne-tune our models. We ﬁrst hire a team of 40 contractors to label our data, based on their performance on a screening test (see Section 3.4 and Appendix B.1 for more details). We then collect a dataset of human-written demonstrations of the desired output behavior on (mostly English) prompts submitted to the OpenAI API3 and some labeler-written prompts, and use this to train our supervised learning baselines. Next, we collect a dataset of human-labeled comparisons between outputs from our models on a larger set of API prompts. We then train a reward model (RM) on this dataset to predict which model output our labelers would prefer. Finally, we use this RM as a reward function and ﬁne-tune our supervised learning baseline to maximize this reward using the PPO algorithm (Schulman et al., 2017). We illustrate this process in Figure 2. This procedure aligns the behavior of GPT-3 to the stated preferences of a speciﬁc group of people (mostly our labelers and researchers), rather than any broader notion of “human values”; we discuss this further in Section 5.2. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. We mainly evaluate our models by having our labelers rate the quality of model outputs on our test set, consisting of prompts from held-out customers (who are not represented in the training data). We also conduct automatic evaluations on a range of public NLP datasets. We train three model 3Speciﬁcally, we train on prompts submitted to earlier versions of the InstructGPT models on the OpenAI API Playground, which were trained only using demonstration data.
