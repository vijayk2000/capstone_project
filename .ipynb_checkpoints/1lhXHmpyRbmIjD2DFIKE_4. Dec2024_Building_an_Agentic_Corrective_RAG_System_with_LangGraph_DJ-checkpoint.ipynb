It is a tender low-growing herb that is grown as a perennial in warm, tropical climates. Basil is originally native to India and other tropical regions of Asia. It has been cultivated there for more than 5,000 years. It is prominently featured in many cuisines throughout the world. Some of them are Italian, Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian cuisines. It grows to between 30–60\\xa0cm tall. It has light green, silky leaves 3–5\\xa0cm long and 1–3\\xa0cm broad. The leaves are opposite each other. The flowers are quite big. They are white in color and arranged as a spike. The plant tastes somewhat like anise, with a strong, pungent, sweet smell. Basil is very sensitive to cold. It is best grown in hot, dry conditions. While most common varieties are treated as annuals, some are perennial, including African Blue and Holy Thai basil. The word \"basil\" comes from the Greek βασιλεύς (\"basileus\"), meaning \"royal\". This is because it is believed to have grown above the spot where St. Constantine and Helen discovered the Holy Cross. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" quotes speculations that basil may have been used in \"some royal unguent, bath, or medicine\". Basil is still considered the \"king of herbs\" by many cookery authors. An alternative etymology has \"basil\" coming from the Latin word \"basilicus\", meaning dragon and being the root for basilisk, but this likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from Greece.'),\n",

As of January 1, 1990, the Roerich Pact had been ratified by ten nations: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela. It went into effect on 26 August 1935. The Government of India approved the Treaty in 1948, but did not take any further formal action. The Roerich Pact is also known as \"Pax Cultura\" (\"Cultural Peace\" or \"Peace through Culture\"). The most important part of the Roerich Pact is the legal recognition that the protection of culture is always more important than any military necessity. Russian painter and philosopher Nicholas Roerich (1874-1947) started the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, in order for a “Peace of Civilizations”. Nicholas Roerich was born on October 9, 1874, in St. Petersburg. He became a successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Nicholas II of Russia.'),\n",

It has approximately 13 million people. Along with the neighboring cities of Navi Mumbai and Thane, it forms the world's 4th largest urban agglomeration. They have around 19.1 million people. The seven islands that form Bombay were home to fishing colonies. The islands were ruled by successive kingdoms and indigenous empires before Portuguese settlers took it. Then, it went to the British East India Company. During the mid-18th century, Bombay became a major trading town. It became a strong place for the Indian independence movement during the early 20th century. When India became independent in 1947, the city was put into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital. It was renamed Mumbai in 1996. Mumbai generates more than 6% of India's GDP. It accounts for 25% of industrial output, 40% of sea trade, and 70% of capital to India's economy. The Reserve Bank of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India and many Indian companies and multinational corporations are in the city.

All rights reserved.\\nYou are here: India\\n\\nEven though New Delhi is the capital city of India, it isn\\'t the city with the highest population in the country. That position goes to Mumbai, which has a population of over 12 million. New Delhi experiences lots of earthquakes, many of them mild. This is because of its location, which lies on several fault lines. \\n\\nNew Delhi was officially declared as the capital of the Union of India after the country gained independence on 15 August 1947.[55] It has expanded since; the small part of it that was constructed during the British period has come to be informally known as Lutyens\\' Delhi.[56]\\nPartition and post-independence\\nDuring the partition of India, around five hundred thousand Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab fled to Delhi, while around three hundred thousand Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan.[59][60] Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi\\'s total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus.[61][62][63] Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013[update]), contributing more to the rise of Delhi\\'s population than the birth rate, which is declining.[64]\\nThe States Reorganisation Act, 1956 created the Union Territory of Delhi from its predecessor, the Chief Commissioner\\'s Province of Delhi.[1][2] According to the 2011 census, Delhi\\'s city proper population was over 11\\xa0million,[6][16] while the NCT\\'s population was about 16.8\\xa0million.[7]\\nDelhi\\'s urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida, Meerut and YEIDA city in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28\\xa0million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).[8]\\nThe topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. In addition to the wetlands formed by the Yamuna river, Delhi continues to retain over 500 ponds (wetlands < 5\\xa0ha (12 acres)), that in turn support considerable number of bird species.[76] Delhi\\'s ponds, despite experiencing ecological deterioration due to garbage dumping and concretisation, support the largest number of bird species known to be using ponds anywhere in the world.[77] Existing policy in Delhi prevents the conversion of wetlands and, quite inadvertently, has led to the city\\'s ponds becoming invaluable refugia for birds.[76][77]\\nThe National Capital Territory of Delhi covers an area of 1,483\\xa0km2 (573\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), of which 783\\xa0km2 (302\\xa0sq\\xa0mi) is designated rural, and 700\\xa0km2 (270\\xa0sq\\xa0mi) urban therefore making it the largest city in terms of area in the country. The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi for more than three centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556.[43] Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name Shahjahanabad, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 and is today known as the Old City or Old Delhi.[44]\\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire\\'s influence declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence.[45] In 1737, Maratha forces led by Baji Rao I sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men\\'s Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\\nToponym\\nThere are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name Delhi.

Straddling the\\nYamuna\\nriver, but spread chiefly to the west, or beyond its\\nright bank\\n, Delhi shares borders with the state of\\nUttar Pradesh\\nin the east and with the state of\\nHaryana\\nin the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nThe NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573\\xa0sq\\xa0mi).\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nAccording to the 2011 census, Delhi\\'s city proper population was over 11\\xa0million,\\n[\\n6\\n]\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nwhile the NCT\\'s population was about 16.8\\xa0million.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nDelhi\\'s urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities\\nGhaziabad\\n,\\nFaridabad\\n,\\nGurgaon\\n,\\nNoida\\n,\\nGreater Noida\\nand\\nYEIDA city\\nlocated in an area known as the\\nNational Capital Region\\n(NCR), has an estimated population of over 28\\xa0million, making it the\\nlargest metropolitan area in India\\nand the\\nsecond-largest in the world\\n(after\\nTokyo\\n).\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe topography of the medieval fort\\nPurana Qila\\non the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel\\nIndraprastha\\nin the Sanskrit epic\\nMahabharata\\n; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. From the early 13th century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the\\nDelhi Sultanate\\nand the\\nMughal Empire\\n, which covered large parts of\\nSouth Asia\\n. All three\\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites\\nin the city, the\\nQutub Minar\\n,\\nHumayun\\'s Tomb\\n, and the\\nRed Fort\\n, belong to this period. Delhi was the early centre of\\nSufism\\nand\\nQawwali\\nmusic. The names of\\nNizamuddin Auliya\\nand\\nAmir Khusrau\\nare prominently associated with it. The\\nKhariboli\\ndialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of\\nUrdu\\nand later\\nModern Standard Hindi\\n. Major Urdu poets from Delhi include\\nMir Taqi Mir\\nand\\nMirza Ghalib\\n. Delhi was a notable centre of the\\nIndian Rebellion of 1857\\n. In 1911,\\nNew Delhi\\n, a southern region within Delhi, became the capital of the\\nBritish Indian Empire\\n. During the\\nPartition of India\\nin 1947, Delhi was transformed from a Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslim residents, in part due to the pressure brought to bear by arriving Hindu and Sikh refugees from western Punjab.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nAfter independence in 1947, New Delhi continued as the capital of the\\nDominion of India\\n, and after 1950 of the\\nRepublic of India\\n.\\nDelhi ranks\\nfifth among the Indian states and union territories\\nin\\nhuman development index\\n,\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nand has the\\nsecond-highest\\nGDP per capita\\nin India (after\\nGoa\\n).\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nAlthough a\\nunion territory\\n, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a\\nstate of India\\n, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a\\nchief minister\\n. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal\\ngovernment of India\\nand the local\\ngovernment of Delhi\\n, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nDelhi hosted the inaugural\\n1951 Asian Games\\n, the\\n1982 Asian Games\\n, the 1983\\nNon-Aligned Movement\\nsummit, the\\n2010 Men\\'s Hockey World Cup\\n, the\\n2010 Commonwealth Games\\n, the\\n2012 BRICS summit\\n, the\\n2023 G20 summit\\n, and was one of the major host cities of the\\n2011\\nand\\n2023 Cricket World Cups\\n.\\nToponym\\nThere are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name\\nDelhi\\n.

The former director of the Archaeological Survey of India, Alexander Cunningham, mentioned that\\ndilli\\nlater became\\ndihli/dehli\\n.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nSome suggest the coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called\\ndehliwal\\n.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nAccording to the\\nBhavishya Purana\\n, King Prithiviraja of\\nIndraprastha\\nbuilt a new fort in the modern-day\\nPurana Qila\\narea for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort\\ndehali\\n.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nSome historians believe that\\nDhilli\\nor\\nDhillika\\nis the original name for the city while others believe the name could be a corruption of the\\nHindustani\\nwords\\ndehleez\\nor\\ndehali\\n—both terms meaning \"threshold\" or \"gateway\"—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the\\nGangetic Plain\\n.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe people of Delhi are referred to as\\nDelhiites\\nor\\nDilliwalas\\n.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nThe city is referenced in various idioms of the Northern\\nIndo-Aryan languages\\n.

Under the second Khalji ruler,\\nAla-ud-din Khalji\\n, the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the\\nNarmada River\\nin the\\nDeccan\\n. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of\\nMuhammad bin Tughluq\\n(1325–1351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to\\nDaulatabad, Maharashtra\\nin central India. However, by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of\\nFiroz Shah Tughlaq\\n(1351–1388), the\\nDelhi Sultanate\\nrapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces.

Under the Afghan\\nLodi dynasty\\n(1451–1526), the sultanate recovered control of Punjab and the\\nGangetic plain\\nto once again achieve domination over Northern India.

New Delhi is the capital of India. Delhi’s metropolitan area and the surrounding rural areas together form the national capital territory of Delhi, an administrative unit somewhat like a state. Delhi occupies a position as a strategic crossroads in South Asia. From Delhi various Hindu and Muslim dynasties, and finally the British, ruled the Indian subcontinent. New Delhi served as the capital of the British Indian Empire from 1911 until India became independent in 1947.\\nSituated some 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of the\\nHimalayas\\n, Delhi is located in north-central India. The elevation of the territory ranges from about 700 to 1,000 feet (215 to 300 meters) above sea level. Delhi lies mainly between the Yamuna River to the east and the northernmost spur of the Aravali Range, called the Delhi Ridge, to the west. Extensive growth following India’s independence led to the city’s expansion on and across the ridge and onto the far bank of the river.\\nCityscape\\nNew Delhi was built to be the capital of India. It was developed to the south of the existing city (now called Old Delhi) between 1912 and 1931 according to the design of British architect\\nSir Edwin Lutyens\\n. Although New Delhi and Old Delhi have become physically integrated, they remain distinct. The dividing line between them is quite sharp. It is marked by a transformation from a complex arrangement of small streets studded with mosques, temples, monuments, crowded bazaars, and residential areas in Old Delhi to the spacious avenues and arcades of shopping centers in New Delhi.\\nOld Delhi is a traditional Indian urban area, crowded with people and bustling with commercial and industrial activity. Chandni Chowk—with its twisting lanes, narrow streets, and crowded bazaars—is the main commercial center of Old Delhi.\\nFrederick M. Asher\\nNew Delhi is a majestic area of parks, tree-shaded boulevards, and mansions. It was planned in a geometric form that combines hexagons, circles, triangles, rectangles, and straight lines. Among its main landmarks are the imposing buildings of the Central Secretariat; the magnificent Rashtrapati Bhavan, which was built as a palace for British viceroys and now houses the president; the Parliament House; and a fashionable shopping center called Connaught Place.\\nLarge-scale public housing developments surround the initial settlement of New Delhi. These developments, which were begun after India became independent, make up large neighborhoods that are segregated according to the rank of the government employees living in them. Wealthy Indians and diplomats, for example, are housed in Chanakyapuri, the diplomatic enclave; military officers in the Dhaulakaun complex; and lower middle-class workers in the Vinay Nagar section. The British built the Civil Lines north of Old Delhi for their senior officers; the neighborhood now houses well-to-do Indians.\\nFrederick M. Asher\\nFrederick M. Asher\\nFrederick M. Asher\\nMany historical monuments in Delhi reveal glimpses of its past. Architecture combining Indian materials and styles with Muslim motifs can be seen in monuments of several periods, particularly the Pashtun (late 12th to early 16th century) and\\nMughal\\n(1526 to 1857). Pashtun sites include\\nQutb Minar\\n, a five-story tower of fluted sandstone; the tombs of the Sayyid and Lodi kings; and the shrine of the Muslim saint Nizam-ud-din. Buildings from the Mughal period such as the\\nRed Fort\\n(Lal Qila), the enormous Jama Masjid (Principal Mosque), and the\\ntomb of the ruler Humayun\\ndisplay bulbous domes, red sandstone and white marble, and elaborate decoration. Monuments of the contemporary period range from a World War I memorial known as the India Gate to a late-20th-century Bahaʾi temple in the shape of a lotus flower. (\\nSee also\\nIndian architecture.)\\nPeople and Culture\\n© hadynyah—E+/Getty Images\\nDelhi is home to a highly diverse population. More than half the residents come from areas outside of the Delhi region. Most of these people have immigrated from neighboring Indian states and nearby countries.\\nDuring the 20th century, the population of the metropolitan area increased some 50-fold. Only about 240,000 people lived there in 1911, while the population reached nearly 12.5 million by 2001. The largest growth occurred between 1941 and 1951, when the population increased by more than 100 percent. Much of that increase was due to immigration following independence and the\\npartitioning of India and Pakistan\\n. The population increased by more than 60 percent over the next decade; in subsequent decades the growth rate hovered around 50 percent for each 10-year census period.\\nDelhi’s enormous growth led to expansion into suburban areas. Despite this, the highly constricted old core became more overcrowded. By the end of the 20th century, Delhi was one of the most densely settled urban areas in India, with an average population density of some 22,000 people per square mile (8,500 per square kilometer). Since the 1950s various government agencies have administered programs to construct new housing and improve older dwellings. Similar initiatives to address sewage disposal and the water supply have had uneven results. One out of every 10 residents of Delhi lived in urban slums called\\njhuggi-jhompri\\ns, which lacked such basic services.\\nP. Chandra\\nDelhi is a major cultural and educational center. It is the location of India’s national academies of art, letters, and music, dance, and drama. In the National Museum one can see a wide variety of artistic treasures from India and Central Asia, including 5,000-year-old relics of the\\nIndus valley civilization\\n. Also housed there are antique Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist sculptures in stone, bronze, and terra-cotta; a fine collection of paintings of the Mughal, Rajput, Deccani, and Pahari schools; ancient jewelry; and painted pottery. The National Gallery of Modern Art, housed in a palace called Jaipur House, exhibits the works of Indian artists from the 19th century onwards.\\nOther cultural facilities include the Hall of Nation Builders, a kind of national portrait gallery located at a museum commemorating\\nMahatma Gandhi\\n; the\\nNehru\\nMemorial Museum;\\nRed Fort Museum\\n; Tibet House, with Tibetan antiquities and religious objects; and the National Museum of Natural History.\\nPrimary education is nearly universal, and secondary education is common. Opportunities for higher education are abundant, with numerous institutions ranging from colleges and universities to computer, engineering, and other technical institutes. As a result, Delhi has emerged as an important center of professional and technical education in India. Among the major institutions are the University of Delhi, the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the Indian Institute of Technology, and Jawaharlal Nehru University.\\nEconomy\\nServices are the largest economic sector in Delhi and also provide the most jobs, though industry also employs substantial numbers of workers. Agriculture, once a mainstay of the regional economy, is no longer a significant sector.\\nDelhi remains one of India’s most important centers for trade, commerce, and the distribution of goods. Many banking and insurance institutions are headquartered there. Tourism also has grown into a major activity.\\nThe industrialization of Delhi started toward the end of the 19th century, but\\nWorld War II\\n, and later India’s independence, accelerated industrial development. There were neither zoning regulations nor a comprehensive plan for urban development, so most industries located wherever space could be found. This led to overcrowding, traffic bottlenecks, and unhealthy living conditions. Despite programs begun in the 1980s to improve air quality, Delhi remains one of the world’s most\\npolluted\\nurban areas.\\nIndustry in Delhi is highly diversified, and the area is known for the sophistication of its electronics, machinery, automobile parts, electrical appliances, and precision instruments. Many of the area’s traditional products, such as copperware and brassware, embroidered textiles, and carvings, are still produced, as are other handicrafts and modern apparel.\\nDelhi is a major hub of the national networks of railways, highways, and air transport systems. Domestic and international airport terminals are located in the southwestern part of the metropolitan area.\\nWithin Delhi, road travel is slowed by some of the world’s worst traffic congestion. The road network and public mass-transport system, long consisting mainly of buses, has been inadequate for the overwhelming volume of traffic in the densely populated urban area. In an effort to reduce motor-vehicle traffic—the leading contributor to the air-pollution problem—Delhi began building a subway and elevated train system in the late 1990s. The first section of the rail line opened in 2002.\\nGovernment\\nUnder\\nIndia’s constitution\\n, Delhi is the national capital territory. It is administered by a lieutenant governor appointed by the president of India. Citizens of Delhi elect the members of the Legislative Assembly that makes most of the local laws. From the membership of the Assembly the president appoints the Council of Ministers, an advisory body led by a chief minister. Three local bodies provide civic services: the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the New Delhi Municipal Council, and the Delhi Cantonment Board. The Delhi Development Authority, founded in 1957, is responsible for developing both residential and commercial areas.\\nHistory\\nThe Delhi region—a triangular area bounded by the hills of the Aravali Range on two sides and the Yamuna River on the third—has been the site of one great city after another. Traditionally, it is said that there have been seven cities of Delhi, though some historians believe that successive cities were built in as many as 15 different localities within the region.\\nThe earliest city in the area was Indraprastha, which is described in the\\nMahabharata\\n, a major\\nSanskrit epic poem\\n. This city was founded in prehistoric times on the right bank of the Yamuna as the capital of the Pandava rulers. In the 1st century\\nbc\\nRaja Dhilu built a new town in the region and named it after himself. It is thought that present-day Delhi gets its name from this king.\\nDelhi rose to prominence in the 12th century\\nad\\n, when the Cauhan ruler Prithviraja III captured a city built by the Tomara rulers and made it his capital. Upon his defeat in the late 12th century, the city passed from Hindu to Muslim control. In various incarnations, it remained the seat of Muslim rulers for most of the next 650 years. In the wake of the changing regimes of different dynasties of the\\nDelhi sultanate\\nand the later\\nMughal emperors\\n, as many as 10 new cities were built between the 13th and mid-17th centuries.\\nThe Mughal emperor\\nShah Jahan\\nbuilt the city Shahjahanabad on the site of what is now Old Delhi. He surrounded it with fortifications, including the\\nRed Fort\\n(Lal Qila), and built the Jama Masjid (Principal Mosque). Soon afterward he was deposed and imprisoned by his son\\nAurangzeb\\n, who brought Delhi to its period of greatest glory. Delhi’s decline began with Aurangzeb’s death in 1707.\\nIn 1739 the city was attacked by\\nNadir Shah\\n, a Persian, who made off with the fabulous Peacock Throne. ʿAlamgir II, the last real emperor, was murdered in 1759. Shah ʿAlam, who assumed the title of emperor, was unable to establish his authority. Delhi became the alternate prey of Afghans and Marathas until 1771, when the Marathas helped to maintain the emperor. In 1788 a Maratha garrison occupied the palace. Shah ʿAlam remained a prisoner there until the British conquest of Delhi.\\nOn March 14, 1803, British General Lord Lake, having defeated the Marathas, seized Delhi. The British administered the city in the name of the emperor, but only the palace remained under his rule. The last of the Delhi emperors was Bahadur Shah II. He was emperor during the first struggle for India’s independence, the\\nmutiny of 1857\\n. Delhi was restored to British civil administration on January 11, 1858. In 1911 the British decided to create a new administrative seat for their Indian Empire, and New Delhi replaced Calcutta (now\\nKolkata\\n) as India’s capital. Construction of New Delhi began in 1912, and the new capital was formally dedicated in 1931.\\nNew Delhi remained the capital after India achieved independence in 1947. Delhi became a union territory, under the direct control of the federal government, in 1956. It was designated the national capital territory and granted a local legislature in the early 1990s. Population (2001 census) Old Delhi, 9,879,172; New Delhi, 302,363; Old Delhi, (2011 est.) 11,007,835; national capital territory, (2011 est.) 17,076,000.\\n×\\nIt’s here: the NEW Britannica Kids website!\\nWe’ve been busy, working hard to bring you new features and an updated design.

Initially, the capital city was in Kolkata when King George V of Britain ordered that the capital be moved to Delhi in 1911. What is the Capital of India? - WorldAtlas\\nWhat is the Capital of India?\\nNew Delhi hosts the President\\'s official residence, known as Rashtrapati Bhavan.\\nIndia, also known as the\\nRepublic of India\\nis located in\\nSouth Asia\\n. India is the 7th largest country and the second most populous country in the world. The official language is Hindi and English, but there is no national language stipulated by the constitution of India. Hindi is the most commonly spoken language followed by Punjabi and then Urdu. Hinduism is the most common religion with 82% of the population adhering to the religion, 12.86% Islam, 0.87% Christianity, and only 0.11% Buddhism. Indo-Aryan is the largest ethnic group followed by Dravidian and then the Mongoloid.\\nThe capital city or the National Capital Territory (NCT) of India is New Delhi. Delhi is divided into two parts; the Old Delhi and New Delhi. The Old Delhi was founded in 1639 while the New Delhi was established on December 15, 1911. New Delhi is located in the north-central part of India and is adjacent south of Delhi city. Initially, the capital city was in Kolkata when King George V of Britain ordered that the capital be moved to Delhi in 1911. The construction of New Delhi started in 1912, but the new capital was dedicated in 1931. Delhi had an estimated population of 18.6 million people in 2016. This makes it the fifth most populous city in the world. Delhi is the largest city in India covering an area of 1484 square kilometers and New Delhi covering 42.7 square kilometers.\\nWhy the Capital City Was Moved from Calcutta to New Delhi?\\nThe reasons why the capital was moved to New Delhi can be divided in three parts; historical, political and geographical reasons.\\nFor political reasons, Delhi had been the capital of many kingdoms that were in the Indian history. There was also a powerful movement centered in Calcutta that resisted the British hence the capital was moved.\\nFor geographical reasons, in the 18th century, Britain had already taken over Calcutta, but the rest of India was still out of their reach. So it was natural for the British to move their capital to New Delhi. Also, many of the territories in northern and central part of India were British colonies.\\nFor historical reasons, Red Fort which is located in New Delhi is a reminder to the British when they defeated the Mughal ruler in 1857. Also, the durbar was held in Delhi so as to welcome the Prince of Wales; hence the British associated Delhi with royal heritage.\\nProblems Facing New Delhi as the Capital City of India\\nNew Delhi faces several problems. One of the main problems is overpopulation which is as a result of rural-urban migration. It has put heavy pressure on the scarce resources that are available. Heavy traffic jam caused by the many vehicles in the city. There is also heavy pollution (air, noise, water, and soil) caused by road dust, noisy neighbors, factories, and vehicles. Due to high population growth, the city is facing serious urbanization problems such as electric power shortage, security, housing problems that have led to a growth of slums, public transport, and poor waste disposal.\\nShare\\nNigel Amaya\\nAugust 9 2018\\nin\\nWorld Facts\\nHome\\nWorld Facts\\nWhat is the Capital of India?\\nRelated\\nWhat Is The Capital Of The Australian Capital Territory?\\nRukhmabai Raut – India\\'s First Practicing Female Doctor\\nMore in\\nWorld Facts\\nThe Largest Countries In Asia By Area\\nOlympic Games History\\nSoutheast Asian Countries\\nIs Australia A Country Or A Continent?\\nIs Turkey In Europe Or Asia?\\nHow Many Countries Are Recognized By The United States?\\nCommonwealth Of Independent States\\nIs Central America Part Of North America?\\nAll maps, graphics, flags, photos and original descriptions © 2024 worldatlas.com\\nHome\\nContact Us\\nPrivacy\\nCopyright\\nAbout Us\\nFact Checking Policy\\nCorrections Policy\\nOwnership Policy\\nContinents\\nAll Continents\\nNorth America\\nCaribbean\\nCentral America\\nSouth America\\nEurope\\nAfrica\\nMiddle East\\nAsia\\nOceania\\nArctic\\nAntarctica\\nCountries\\nAll Countries\\nUS Maps\\nChina Maps\\nRussia Maps\\nPhilippines Maps\\nEgypt Maps\\nGeography\\nBodies of Water\\nLandforms\\nPlaces\\nNature\\nAll Geography\\nEducation\\nHistory\\nScience\\nSocial Science\\nSociety\\nEconomics\\nPolitics\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nPrivacy\\nCopyright\\nSearch WorldAtlas\\n\\nWhat is the oldest language?Endangered and extinct dialects, explained\\nWorld’s most populous city:Top 10 cities in the world, US ranked\\nHow many states are in India?\\nIndia is home to 28 states, each with its own capital and run by a Governor who represents the President:\\nIndia also has eight union territories, governed by an Administrator appointed by the President:\\nWhat state is New Delhi in?\\nNew Delhi is part of one of India’s union territories, the National Capital Territory of Dehli.

       "The essential design patterns for developing Agentic AI systems include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Reflection**: This pattern involves AI agents evaluating and improving their own outputs through self-critique and iterative refinement. It allows agents to identify errors, gaps, or areas needing improvement and make necessary adjustments. This is particularly useful in tasks requiring precision, such as content creation, problem-solving, or code generation.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Tool Use**: This pattern equips AI agents with the ability to utilize external tools or resources to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. By integrating with web services, databases, or other software tools, AI systems can perform tasks beyond their inherent capabilities, such as data retrieval, automation, and complex function execution.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Planning**: Planning enables AI agents to autonomously devise a sequence of actions needed to achieve complex objectives. This involves breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable components and determining the most efficient path to completion. It is crucial for tasks requiring strategic decision-making and coordination, such as project management and logistics.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: This pattern involves multiple AI agents working together, each specializing in different aspects of a task. It mimics human collaborative efforts, allowing agents to contribute their unique skills to achieve a common goal. This is particularly effective in scenarios requiring diverse expertise, such as healthcare, supply chain management, and large-scale analytics.\n",
       "\n",
       "These design patterns enhance the capabilities and efficiency of AI agents, enabling them to operate autonomously, adapt to dynamic environments, and tackle complex tasks with minimal human intervention. By leveraging these patterns, developers can create robust, scalable, and efficient AI systems."

A large portion of the population is still engaged in agriculture. Since the early 1990s, India has liberalized its economy by reducing government control over foreign trade and investment, leading to rapid economic growth.
